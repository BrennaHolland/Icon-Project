    <p><span style="color:grey">Fort Lee, NJ,</span> — When Dawn Wooten blew the whistle on a doctor performing unwanted hysterectomies at an ICE detention camp, she didn’t just unearth horrific malpractice
      happening in her workplace. Wooten, who was a
      practicing nurse at the camp, also sparked a national conversation about the state of gynecologic care.</br>
      <br> At the camp, a young woman named Pauline Binam visited the doctor to discuss her irregular periods. Later, during a procedure to remove a mild cyst, she had a fallopian tube removed without her consent, likely ending her ability to ever
      get
      pregnant. </br>
      <br>The choice to remove Binam’s fallopian tube is emblematic of an attitude that is, at times, pervasive in the gynecologic community: that removing parts of women’s reproductive organs is the quickest and most effective solution for unwanted
      symptoms.</br>
      <br>A state-wide, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25542564/">Michigan study</a> found that 37.7% of women who had hysterectomies had no prior treatment for their condition before the date of their surgery.</br>
      <br> Hysterectomies, of which there are 500,000 annually in the US, entail the removal of the uterus and, sometimes, the ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix and surrounding structures. Hysterectomies jump-start menopause, end your ability to get
      pregnant and severely limit your ability to produce estrogen. </br>
      <br>Many doctors believe the conditions that most-often lead women to the operating room, do not have effective, alternative treatments. This opinion is reinforced—in a
      self-proclaimed prophecy kind of way—by the fact that the second-most common
      surgery performed on women is hysterectomies. By the time they are 60-years-old, one-in-three American women will have undergone a hysterectomy.</br>
    </p>


    <div class="boxed">
      <p>There are four main reasons for this: </p>


      <img src="uterus.png" width="125" height="125" align="left">
      <p>Uterine fibroids are the most common reason for hysterectomies, accounting for one-third of the national total. Fibroids are non-cancerous growths on the uterus and can range from the size of a pea, to the size of a football. For many women,
        fibroids never cause discomfort and never require treatment. For others, symptoms can be debilitating: heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, pain during sex and low-back pain.</p>

      <img src="cramps.png" width="125" height="125" align="left">
      <p>Endometriosis is the second most-common reason women get hysterectomies. This condition occurs when endometrial tissue begins to grow outside the uterus and on nearby organs. Symptoms include painful periods, heavy bleeding and chronic
        pelvic pain.</p>
      <img src="ouch.png" width="125" height="125" align="left">
      <p>Uterine prolapse occurs when pelvic floor muscles weaken, allowing the uterus to move from its normal position and into the vagina. Uterine prolapse is often the result of a difficult pregnancy or labor, and can be very uncomfortable to live
        with. Women often feel a sensation of heaviness on their pelvis, or difficulty with urinating and bowel movements. </p>

      <img src="hips.png" width="125" height="125" align="left">
      <p>Adenomyosis is a condition that occurs when cells lining the uterus grow into the uterine wall. As with fibroids, most women who have adenomyosis show no symptoms and are totally unaware of their condition. Those who do experience symptoms
        may have prolonged menstrual cycles and cramping that tends to get worse with each new period. </p>

    <p>For reasons that remain unclear, Black women are two-to-three times more likely to have fibroids, have larger fibroids and have worse symptoms than white women. Recent research suggests there may be a link between chronic stress and fibroids,
      implying generational trauma and racism may be at play here.</br>

      <br>In her book, “Everything Below the Waist: Why Healthcare Needs a Feminist Revolution,” Jennifer Block interviewed Tanika Gray, founder of fibroid advocacy group, the White Dress Project. </br>

      <br>“It was just kind of like a way of life when I started listening to women’s stories. It was just like, yeah, we got fibroids. Yeah, my mother had a hysterectomy—I’ll probably have one too. It just felt wrong,” Gray said.</br>
      <br>Women with chronic fibroids are often faced with a terrible choice: live with unwanted symptoms, or get a hysterectomy. What is often left out of the conversation, are the less damaging, alternative treatmentsbr </br>
      <br>A laparoscopic myomectomy—a procedure Gray herself underwent—allows a surgeon to remove fibroids through small incisions, without removing necessary reproductive tissue. </br>
      <br>Although hysterectomies were once considered the most effective treatment for endometriosis, there has been movement within the medical community to focus on procedures that only remove endometrial tissue. </br>
      <br>Uterine prolapse, being essentially a muscle issue, can be improved through pelvic floor strengthening exercises, also known as kegels. Symptoms of adenomyosis can be treated with hormone therapy in the form of oral contraceptives.</br>
      <br>While there’s no doubt that hysterectomies can be the right choice for women who have exhausted their alternative treatment options, too often, we hear about women, like Binam, who were never presented with these alternatives. </br>
